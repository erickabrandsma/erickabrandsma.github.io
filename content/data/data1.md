I'm so grateful that you've made it here. 

#### A few years ago, I started living by quote I saw on Pinterest; it goes something like this: "Let yourself be drawn by the strange pull of what you really love... and run!". I'm still finding my place in the world and my reason to run, but I'd like to think I've at least begun jogging! 



For the past three years, I've been a Project Manager at Column, a civic tech startup building technology to improve the utility of public interest information. More simply, I work with newspapers to bring their public notice processes into the 21st century. I've been on the ground with legal advertising clerks in Fargo, ND, managed Column's first-ever acquisition of an obituaries and classifieds company, and worked with C-suite members of top newspaper publishing groups like Lee Enterprises, Ogden Newspapers, and CherryRoad Media. A pretty great first job out of college, if you ask me! 

Previously, I attended the beloved Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison and graduate with an Economics and Mathematics double major. I was a member of the intercollegite mock trial team and served in various leadership positions on the campus's largest economics organization. I spent my colleigate summers cutting my teeth at larger organizations in a variety of industries and functional areas, specifically through internships at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Aon, and the Einstein Project.

 Today, I work remotely and have loved spending the last few years living in a variety of cities from Brooklyn to Honolulu to Portland. In my free time, I serve on the UW Economics Department's Young Alumni Council and play piano at a local nursing home. I also love challenging myself with new skills and rediscovering old passions including dancing, climbing, and creating art. *Be sure to check out the projects tab to see some of the creations I'm most proud off*!
