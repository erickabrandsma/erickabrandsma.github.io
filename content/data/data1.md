## what i do
#### professional + personal
I'm currently a Project Manager at Column, a civic tech startup building technology to improve the utility of public interest information. We are building technology to improve the utility of public interest information, beginning with public notice.<br>

 I work remotely and have loved spending the last few years living in a variety of cities from New York City to Honolulu to Portland. In my free time, I love challenging myself with new skills and rediscovering old passions including ballet, climbing, and creating art *(be sure to check out my art page)*!
