##### My time at Column 
###### Column was my first full-time role and I got pretty lucky. During my 3 year tenure, I gained a plethora of new skills and scored some great headshots along the way! The photo below is from our offsite in Alta, Utah following the annoucement of our Series A round ($33.3M raised)!
