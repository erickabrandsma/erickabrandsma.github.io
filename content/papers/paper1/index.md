## Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 

### Strategic Planning Intern
##### *June 2020 – Aug. 2020*

With the pandemic raging, I worked from my tiny,shared college apartment for the entirety of my intership with the [Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago](https://www.chicagofed.org/). While I was disappointed I couldn't be in Chicago, I embraced remote work and was able to make lasting connections. 

I spend the majority of the summer working for the Bank services team, collecting and analyzing Excel data on current projects and providing suggestions to optimize the number of work hours spent completing these projects. 

While the aforementioned was all a part of my formal job description, I was more proud of the community-building I spearheaded during that summer. The 2020 summer was the first time interns were working remotely and most companies, including the Fed, didn't have any insfrastructure built for a virtual environment. I noticed that our intern cohort intially lacked collaboration and a sense of community, so I organized and moderated a weekly virtual intern happy hour. This happy hour took on a life of its own and quickly became so much more: intern-led workshops, ERG groups and virtual coworking sessions. I'm grateful to know that I left my mark on the program; to this day, I've been told that the infrastructure that I built for the intern program stands and intern-led traditions continue to fuel lasting connections.
